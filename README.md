### Goal 

The goal was to create an **Android application** using the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started).

The user can search YouTube videos. He will get a list of videos that will be display in a `RecyclerView`.

Then, he can click on those videos to display a more detailed `view` about the video. 

Of course, he can watch it thanks to the [YouTube Android Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/).
