### Goal 

The goal was to create an **Android application** using the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started).

### Features

- **Search YouTube videos:** you can make queries with the `searchview`, a list of videos will be displayed in a `RecyclerView` using `CardView`.

- **Keep history of previous queries:** all the previous queries are saved even if the app is closed. The user is assisted with text completion.

- **Display the videos:** click on the video to display a more detailed `view` about it, where you will be able to watch the video thanks to the [YouTube Android Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/).

- **Home button:** click on the home `action` located in the `appbar` to display the trending YouTube videos.
